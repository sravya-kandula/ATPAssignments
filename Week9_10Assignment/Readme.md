## Prerequisites

Before running this project, make sure the following software is installed:

- Node.js
- npm
- MongoDB
- Git
- VS Code (Recommended)

---

## Move into Project Folder

```bash
cd ATP-mern/week9-10/BlogApp
```

---

## Backend Setup

### Step 1: Open Backend Folder

```bash
cd backend
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 3: Create .env File

Create a `.env` file inside the backend folder.

### Example .env File

```env
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
```

---

## Run Backend Server

```bash
npm start
```

OR

```bash
npm run dev
```

Backend server will run on:

```bash
http://localhost:5000
```

---

## Frontend Setup

### Step 1: Open Frontend Folder

Open a new terminal.

```bash
cd frontend
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

---

## Run Frontend

```bash
npm run dev
```

Frontend will run on:

```bash
http://localhost:5173
```

---

## MongoDB Setup

### Local MongoDB

Start MongoDB locally before running backend.

```bash
mongod
```

### MongoDB Atlas

You can also use MongoDB Atlas cloud database.

1. Create MongoDB Atlas account
2. Create a cluster
3. Copy connection string
4. Paste connection string in `.env` file
